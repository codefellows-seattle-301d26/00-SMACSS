##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?
I put the rules that were styling classes or ids in module.css, anything that had to do with broad stroke layout I put in layout.css. I used reset.css for a reset file.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

(Put your answer here)
