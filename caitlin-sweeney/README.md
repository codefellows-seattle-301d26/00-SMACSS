##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

base dealt with broad rules on html page. 
layout dealt with broad rules for html elements.
reset was to bring elements to a base line across different browsers.
module caught everything else more specfic. 



##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No because functionality of website is currently in tact.If I refactored I would sort Module.css further into states.css and theme.css.
