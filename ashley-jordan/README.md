##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

With help from the lovely SMACSS book I determined what each CSS rules was doing so I could properly place them in the right file. Things that affected the layout went into layout.css, reset.css went into base.css, and things such as classes, or whatever did not fit into the other files went into modules.css.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not really do any refactoring.
