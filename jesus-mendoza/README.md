##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

If it referred to an element then i would put it in the layout and if it referred to a specific class or id i places it in the modules file.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

none other than placing it in the different folders.
