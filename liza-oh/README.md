##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I used the documentation provided in the reading to determine what should go where. I moved everything from reset to base. Then I moved everything with an id or class to modules and everything without a class or id (or core structure) to layout.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No, I did not. Everything seems to be working fine.
